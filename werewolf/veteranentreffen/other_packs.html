<h2 id="_schatten_der_zaren"><a class="anchor" href="#_schatten_der_zaren"></a>Schatten der Zaren</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most prominent pack, centre of the alliance. "Schatten der Zaren" is a pack of werewolves living to the north of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"). Their territory is centred on the
[Peter and Paul
fortress.](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_fortress" class="bare">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_fortress</a>) Some
members of the pack are among the oldest werewolves in the city. The
pack is also the centre of the loose [alliance](alliance "wikilink") of
werewolves in St. Petersburg, as the 'High Judge' is their alpha.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Schatten der Zaren" claims the largest Forsaken territory in the City,
extending a good part to the north and west of their stronghold. As a
blessed pack, with many members of high renown rank, and due to their
leader being High Judge, they are somewhat the "alpha pack of packs",
though they never make their leading role explicit so as not to stir up
trouble. They keep to themselves, but are willing to offer advice if
sought out on proper terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They often used to function as mentors for the young werewolves of the
Shadowclaws, but this has largely ceased since the Shadowclaws have
started expanding their territory and showing that they can stand on
their own feet (and claws).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The [totem](Window-to-the-West "wikilink") of "Schatten der Zaren" is
rumoured to be an old spirit of learning, though little is known about
it. The pack is highly protetive of their totem and its identity.</p>

<h2 id="_litanei_der_straßen"><a class="anchor" href="#_litanei_der_straßen"></a>Litanei der Straßen</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secluded pack, mostly minding their own business. They honour the
alliance but don&#8217;t expect it to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A pack of werewolves who claim their territory to the north of the
Shadowclaws. Part of the [alliance](alliance "wikilink") of werewolves
in central St. Petersburg.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Litanei der Straßen" is probably a more typical pack of werewolves.
They largely mind their own business, resent any interference by
outsiders and protect their territory fiercely. They have a certain
esoteric touch, and it is not known what their pack totem is. In fact
little is known about the pack beside its members and its very
territorial nature - except that they keep their territory clean and
that it is supposedly very unhealthy to enter it unannounced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Litanei der Straßen" has had little dealings with the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"), partially because of their
reclusiveness, but also because their territories do not border. Only
Yelena and [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") have met at times, due to their
common [lodge](Bear_Hunters "wikilink") - the
[Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink") members of the pack regularly
attend the (rare) meetings of the lodge, but neither had much talk with
[Angus](Angus "wikilink") outside of
that.</p>

<h2 id="_glasfelle"><a class="anchor" href="#_glasfelle"></a>Glasfelle</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An unconventional pack, consisting mostly of Iron Masters. They have a
very modern approach to life as a werewolf.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'Glasfelle' is a pack of werewolves living to the east of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"). They are also part of the
[alliance](alliance "wikilink"). This pack is the most 'friendly' of the
neighbours the Shadowclaws have, and especially their Iron Masters
maintain good ties with the players. Shuro has also been of help at
times, though he usually is not very forthcoming with advice, preferring
for the Shadowclaws to solve problems themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 'Glasfelle' are dominated by Iron Master ideology: They take a very
modern approach to maintaining a territory. Since two of their three
members are also in the [Lodge of Shepherds](Shepherds "wikilink"), they
have very good contact with the humans in their territory. Andrei is the
alpha of the pack (and the leader of the shepherds), though it seems
that most decisions are made by the member first encountering them and
then accepted by the pack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other packs watch the modern approach of the Glasfelle with disapproval,
but it appears to be working well. Their territory matches that of most
other packs in size - yet there are only three of them. Shuro seems to
do most of the fighting, and the spirits tell many tales about his
legendary skills in combat. It is noteworthy that no werewolves outside
the pack have seen him fight yet, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pack&#8217;s totem, called "Ubuntu", is a spirit of community. It helps
the two Shepherds understand the humans in their territory even better,
and seems to enable the pack to communicate over longer
distances.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Andrei Wind-in-den-Straßen](Andrei_Wind-in-den-Straßen "wikilink")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Shuro Koshonin](Shuro_Koshonin "wikilink")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Vanka Iosiforna](Vanka_Iosiforna "wikilink")</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_crimson_tears"><a class="anchor" href="#_crimson_tears"></a>Crimson Tears</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neighbours of the players', the two packs have often clashed. The pack
changed a lot [recently](Battle_against_Rote_Wut "wikilink").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Crimson Tears claim the former territory of [Rote
Wut](Rote_Wut "wikilink") to the south of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"). They were founded by [Die
Amazone](Die_Amazone "wikilink"), the last member of the Rote Wut. They
favour a different approach though: Where Rote Wut was known for its
brutality and rejection of the [alliance](alliance "wikilink"), the
Crimson Tears are a part of it and seem to be more open to dialogue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Shadowclaws have a favour remaining from [die
Amazone](die_Amazone "wikilink") for letting the pack use their locus.
They also helped out in a fight once, so relations seem to be quite
good. In a [recent](Breeding_Grounds "wikilink") attack by the Pure, die
Amazone was killed. Speaks-for-the-dead has taken the favour she owed
the Shadowclaws.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since then, Boneblade has taken the Role of Alpha, and the pack has
again taken a more rejective stance towards the
[alliance](alliance "wikilink"), not showing up on any meetings except
for the [obituary](In_memory_of_Amazone "wikilink") of its former alpha.
Still, they have not formally declared that they leave the alliance. The
pack&#8217;s leadership seems to rest mostly on Sergei and Arja, and both are
not very open for dialogue with werewolves outside the pack. The Crimson
Tears have made it clear they will kill trespassers, but unlike Rote Wut
have also stated they will stick to their territory - and they seem to
have observed this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The totem of the [Crimson Tears](Crimson_Tears "wikilink") is said to be
the spirit of a certain building in their territory, where the pack
regularly meets. Rumour says its a bar (with illegal fights in the
basement), but this is not confirmed and so far noone wanted to draw
their anger by investigating matters of the pack.</p>

<h2 id="_unbound"><a class="anchor" href="#_unbound"></a>Unbound</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very rare thing for werewolves, there are still some who do not bind
themselves by pack and territory, instead choosing to wander, spending
their lives travelling. Most of these meet a quick end at the claws of a
more territorially inclined pack, but there are some who have the wits,
resources or usefulness to survive.</p>
