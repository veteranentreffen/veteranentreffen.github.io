<div class="paragraph">
<p>High ranking sewer spirit with an associated court, most likely part of
the [water spirits](Die_Flüssigen "wikilink"). Was disposed by the

<h3 id="_cinema_spirit"><a class="anchor" href="#_cinema_spirit"></a>Cinema Spirit</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The spirit of the local [cinema](Spartak_cinema "wikilink"), of assumed
Jaggling rank. The pack has had some fairly reasonable contacts with it.
The spirit helped the pack create a large amount of darkness essence, to
lure and ultimately kill a darkness spirit. Recently, the pack has
learned of the theatre spirits from the Cinema Spirit. Angus is
re-viving a [cinema club](cinema_club "wikilink") as part of the
payment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_daemonium"><a class="anchor" href="#_daemonium"></a>Daemonium</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A spirit of St. Petersburg, suffering and violence. It embodies the
aspect of the city as a place built on the blood of innocents, a
battlefield, and the centre of an emerging military power. It seems to
have once been allied to the Pure, but since the reconquest of the city
by the Forsaken no werewolf has seen it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_eepeeps"><a class="anchor" href="#_eepeeps"></a>EepEeps</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Information spirits friendly to the pack. They call the pack&#8217;s main
[locus](Old_radio "wikilink") their home and have made a deal with the
pack encompassing the following points:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The pack will protect the EepEeps from other spirits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pack owns the locus, giving them free access anytime they want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EepEeps are entitled to half the essence generated by the locus.
They inform the pack if there is trouble on their side of the locus.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_eternal_grace"><a class="anchor" href="#_eternal_grace"></a>Eternal Grace</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A name applying to two highly ranked members of the [court of Eternal
Grace](court_of_Eternal_Grace "wikilink"): [Prince
Yaromir](Prince_Yaromir "wikilink") and [the
maiden](the_maiden "wikilink"). Why exactly that is and if there is any
sensible reason remains to be seen.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_giftläufer"><a class="anchor" href="#_giftläufer"></a>Giftläufer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spirits in the service of the [Great Slimy

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_great_slimy_one"><a class="anchor" href="#_great_slimy_one"></a>Great Slimy One</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 'Great Slimy One' was a lesser Jaggling that manifested in the
sewers due to the biological waste [transported there by some criminal
elements](fight_in_the_sewers "wikilink"). It quickly took over the main
locus in the sewers (situated right on the origin of the contamination),
replacing [Athumu](Athumu "wikilink"), and established its own court. In
the following weeks, the court grew stronger and stronger, until it was
the predominant court throughout most of the sewers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The [Giftläufer](Giftläufer "wikilink") were a kind of spirit that
provided muscle for his court, and an enemy the pack repeatedly faced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He was eventually discorporated by the pack and subsequently destroyed
during the [cleansing of its locus](fight_in_the_sewers "wikilink").</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_großer_sirocool"><a class="anchor" href="#_großer_sirocool"></a>Großer Sirocool</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A spirit of a great hacker. Believed to be of Jaggling rank, very
possibly Greater Jaggling. Might be part of the
[Network](Network "wikilink") court.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_kaffeehaus"><a class="anchor" href="#_kaffeehaus"></a>Kaffeehaus</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The [spirit](spirits "wikilink") of [Café
Alexanderplatz](Café_Alexanderplatz "wikilink"), a member of the [Court
of Eternal Grace](Court_of_Eternal_Grace "wikilink"). It previously was
the spirit of another café that became collateral damage during [the
fate of The Bleeding Stone](the_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink").
The [pack](Shadowclaws "wikilink") has convinced it to try and remove
the barren; they have gathered and coerced spirits for its brood or for
consumption and provided essence and security, both themselves and via a
deal with [Blood of the City](Blood_of_the_City "wikilink").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kaffeehaus is of greater Gaffling rank, probably of medium power among
greater Gafflings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_meister_im_norden"><a class="anchor" href="#_meister_im_norden"></a>Meister im Norden</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enigmatic and mostly unknown high-ranking spirit in the
[sewers](sewers "wikilink"). Is believed to be a spirit of the times of
old, smuggling and taking no orders.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_nevskys_sword"><a class="anchor" href="#_nevskys_sword"></a>Nevskys Sword</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevskys Sword is a [Steel Predator](Steel_Predators "wikilink"), the
[spirit](spirits "wikilink") of the [Alexander Nevsky
Bridge](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nevsky_Bridge" class="bare">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nevsky_Bridge</a>) located at
the eastern border of the no-mans-land, bordering the
[Glasfelle](Glasfelle "wikilink") territory and close to the [Crimson
Tears](Crimson_Tears "wikilink"). Still, its influence stretches right
to the current eastern border of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The spirit is very powerful, its name evokes a certain awe in the Hisil
of Petersburg. According to [Andrei
Wind-in-den-Straßen](Andrei_Wind-in-den-Straßen "wikilink"), it is of
Greater Jaggling rank and he and his pack go to a certain length to
prevent provocating it. He says the name is from a famous quote of the
russian hero Alexander Nevsky, namesake of the bridge: "He who comes to
us with a sword, from a sword will perish.". The bridge feeds on all
passing spirits, and it has a number of "spirit packs" at its service
that drive or lure prey to the bridge, feeding on the scraps left by the
powerful Jaggling.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pitch_black"><a class="anchor" href="#_pitch_black"></a>Pitch Black</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pitch Black is a spirit of the [Grey Court](Grey_Court "wikilink"), a
rival of
[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost](She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost "wikilink").
Little is known about him, but he must be of Jaggling Rank.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_prince_of_the_river"><a class="anchor" href="#_prince_of_the_river"></a>Prince of the River</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very high-ranking spirit, of at least Jaggling rank, quite possibly
higher. He most likely belongs the court of [water
spirits](Die_Flüssigen "wikilink") The pack owes him four favours, of
unspecified duration and level of danger. For these favours, the Prince
helped the pack with the rite to cleanse the [Great Slimy
One&#8217;s](Great_Slimy_One "wikilink") locus, providing five lesser
Gafflings that would be destroyed in the process. The bargaining only
implied that these favours have to at least theoretically be possible
for the pack to achieve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the five favours was [called
in](The_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink") recently, giving the pack
the opportunity to get free of all of them - which they chose not to do.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_prince_yaromir"><a class="anchor" href="#_prince_yaromir"></a>Prince Yaromir</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A spirit of a [now-destroyed
theatre](garbage-burning_facility "wikilink") of at Greater Jaggling
rank. It seems Prince Yaromir is a spirit of acting and theater in
general, a fact he [impressively displayed](reality_theatre "wikilink")
by manipulating the werewolves of Petersburg so they unwittingly
participated in a play designed to strengthen his
[court](Court_of_Eternal_Grace "wikilink").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably not coincidently, this is also the name of the male main
character of a famous (in Russia, that is) russian theatre play, based
on an old tale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Strangely, another name this spirit goes by is [Eternal
Grace](Eternal_Grace "wikilink") - a name shared by another Greater
Jaggling of his court, [the maiden](the_maiden "wikilink").</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rahglu"><a class="anchor" href="#_rahglu"></a>Rahglu</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A strange breed of spirit and flesh, the Rhaglu appear as sheep-sized
wasps. Little is known about them, and it took Angus days to find their
name even with help of the [Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink"). The
few facts that are known are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are not Spirits (at least not fully). The Ithalunim did not
even know the names of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They seem to posses strength in numbers. A lone Rhaglu is weak, but
when the [pack](Shadowclaws "wikilink") was
[ambushed](Breeding_Grounds "wikilink") by 7 of them it was almost
wiped out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have a hive-like structure, as there are many underneath [St.
Nicholaus Cathedral](St._Nicholaus_Cathedral "wikilink"). At least 3
types exist: Simple 'workers' wo make up the majority, fierce
warriors wo seem primarily concerned with protecting the nest, and
queens which probably function as some sort of hive mind, as she is
not needed for laying eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They procreate by laying eggs into humans, which then hatch within
about a month, consuming their hosts. They favour wolfblooded since
these have a higher-than-average stamina, allowing for more eggs to
successfully hatch. All workers can lay eggs, not only the queen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have a basic understanding of human society, hiding their
victims and acting as to not draw too much attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They seem to communicate based on scent, and supernaturally strong
odours are known to disrupt their unity, making them far easier to
battle.</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>A spirit of lesser Jaggling rank, also known as "lost Daughter". She
embodies the concepts of mourning and fear of losing someone/something.
She often appears as a large foetus in red clothes. Her first concept
was the spirits of the aborted children of prostitutes, hence her
appearance. Originally she was part of the [Red
Choir](Red_Choir "wikilink"), but she escaped during the events of the

<pre>The pack (or rather [Aleksandr](Aleksandr "wikilink") bargaining

lives, so the pack has a safe way out should the need arise. Aleksandr
would probably oppose it, but [Angus](Angus "wikilink") seems quite
willing to use this threat at least as a bargaining chip.</pre>

<pre>The deal compromises the following points:</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both parties will refrain from any path of action that could lead to
direct attacks on the other parties. This is basically a
non-aggression treaty with the added security of not being allowed

</li>
<li>
<p>The pack will be allowed to use her main
[locus](Black_locus "wikilink") to cross the Gauntlet, and the
Werewolves are entitled to a third of the essence generated by the
locus.</p>

by [Prince Yaromir](Prince_Yaromir "wikilink"), another Jaggling of her
court, designed to bring [the Bleeding
Stone](the_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink") over to the court. Strangely
enough, [Angus](Angus "wikilink") learned that another name for her
might be [Eternal Grace](Eternal_Grace "wikilink"), a name that also
applies to [Prince Yaromir](Prince_Yaromir "wikilink").</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two very weird [spirits](spirits "wikilink") that are reflections of a
    riot at [Wilhelmplatz](Wilhelmplatz "wikilink") some 150 years ago. They
    appear in the weeks preceding the anniversary of the riot and start
    recruiting local spirits to their cause. How exactly this recruitment
    works is unclear, but it is on a subconscious basis and even affects
    werewolves. Recruits feel a strong urge to fight for their master, and
    are usually motivated by a promise of essence and feeding opportunities.
    The two parties clash on the date at Wilhelmplatz, were many spirits are
    discorporated and the area is drained of essence. This has led to the
    formation of a Barren.</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>The followers of Son and Nephew consist entirely of Gafflings - it is
unclear if this is due to the fact that Jagglings can feel the influence
and leave the area beforehand or if they are immune. Still, the entire
area is split among their followers and the widespread destruction will
not spare anyone who declares no allegiance to either.</pre>

<div class="content">
<pre>    Following [recent events](Petersburg_Wilhelmplatz "wikilink"), the
    combat between the two spirits has been ritualised, the pack providing a
    combatant and the price (a greater Gaffling). As such, the growth of the
    Barren has been stopped, yet there is still a spiritual wasteland that
    will take much effort to remove ... and it remains to be seen what
becomes of the two spirits.</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A spirit of St. Petersburg, lore, and learning. Embodies the aspecet of
the city as a window towards a more enlightened world, and as a place of
progress. It is the patron totem of the
[Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink"), but has only a very small court
after more than a century of persecution by the Pure.</p>

<h3 id="_wissendes_auge_der_nacht"><a class="anchor" href="#_wissendes_auge_der_nacht"></a>Wissendes Auge der Nacht</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wissendes Auge der Nacht is a stray cat spirit encountered by the pack
during their rite of initiation. After the spirit repeatedly stole
essence from an area the pack was guarding, they tracked it down and
gave it a simple choice: Become our totem or perish.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wissendes Auge der Nacht does not trust easily - as is reflected in its
ban. The initial relationship with the pack was quite strained, given
the blunders the newly changed werewolves made during their first
dealings with the spirit wild. However, as they worked toward securing
their territory, the spirit became a valuable ally, particularly in
their struggle against the [Great Slimy
One](Great_Slimy_One "wikilink").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Chorus Numina allows Wissendes Auge der Nacht to call upon other
[cat spirits](Cat_Spirits "wikilink") in the territory.</p>
