<p>We&#8217;d like to increase the number of Breaking Points. The idea in Book seems to be that anything drawing you to spiritual side is BP towards Spirit, anything drawing to physical side is BP towards flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, most rolls seem to be based on denying the other side; what if <em>fulfilling one</em> were also a Breaking Point? Extensive Gift usage a Breaking Point towards spirit, mundane solutions using advanced tools towards flesh, the apex of a challenging <em>Siskur-Dah</em> towards spirit, a night out with the boys towards flesh? Probably this shouldn&#8217;t be hard-coded as that would be an endless list and lots of bookkeeping, but if we keep an eye on it during play?</p>

<p>There is also a paragraph on personal Breaking Points which sounds promising, but will we manage to implement them?</p>

tells listeners you&#8217;re a non-native speaker. A score of *\*\* allows
for the active use of different dialects, full command of the language
and an extensive vocabulary. With this level it is possible to fool
almost all people into believing you are a native speaker. Most native
speakers do not have this level of proficiency.</p>

other objects as focal point. If the focal point is not a locus, the
following restrictions apply:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The object must have a spirit of at least Greater Gaffling rank,
which has to cooperate throughout the rite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The spirit (and object) must be aligned with the kind of resonance
sought (e.g., a white flag for "peacefulness" or "french")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The area affected spreads out from the object with the same radius
that a locus of equal rank to the spirit would have (i.e., two yards
for a lesser gaffling, 15 for a greater gaffling, up to a city block
for a minor god). There is no factor of 3, as the "boost" from the
locus is lacking</p>

<h4 id="_what_is_this_about"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_is_this_about"></a>What is this about?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right now, in my experience, Combat in WoD quickly boils down to:
everyone roll damage, regenerate, start over. Few dramatic things
happen, indeed sometimes combat just drags out until one side has rolled
enough successes. I like the nWoD system a lot, but after seeing DnD4,
which at its core is more a tactical combat simulation than an RPG, and
Savage Worlds, where one can effectively (and even does rather often)
substitute a cool action for a simple attack roll, combat seems a bit
disappointing. After Christoph said he had the same feeling, I came up
with a few ideas to remedy that fact and put tactis back into combat.
Werewolves fight a lot, they are supposed to fight as a pack, and that
should involve more than just enjoying the penalty to defense an
opponent gets for multiple attackers (more on that later).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is easy to come up with some examples where the result of a roll
might be influenced by additional actions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Rahu fighting another Werewolf could try to slam his opponent into
a nearby closet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fleeing Irraka could try to topple trash cans and similar things
to hinder his pursuer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Ithaeur could use a gift to create a distraction to shooting
enemies so he and his pack can cross the killing ground easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While fighting a number of spirits, the Elodoth tries to lure one
opponent into the midst of the pack by slowly moving backwards,
hoping the spirit realises to late that its flanks are no longer
covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a fight erupts on the side of a big street, the Cahalith tries
to use the weight of his Urshul form to push an attacker into
traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are new rules (largely) tested by Christoph and Jan. They will
likely be implemented at the next meeting, but are still open for
discussion and suggestions until then.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_stunts_in_combat"><a class="anchor" href="#_stunts_in_combat"></a>Stunts in Combat</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to try performing a stunt instead of your normal attack
roll. This usually means you roll Attribute+Skill, minus a fitting
Resistance if an opponent is targeted:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Rahu rolls his Strength+Brawl-Defense as usual, but on a success
he does not deal normal damage, instead slamming his opponent into
the closet (where he will likely take further damage and be hindered
next turn as determined by the GM).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Irraka rolls Wits+Composure, minus the opponents Resolve.
Successes achieved penalize his opponents roll this turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ithaheur rolls his Gift and counts as resistance the highest in
the group+1. If he succeeds, all enemies take a penalty to shooting
attack rolls until the Gift ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Elodoth rolls Presence+(Intimidate or Subterfuge) - Resistance.
If he succeeds, he can pull the spirits into the ranks of the pack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Cahalith rolls Strength+Size-opponent&#8217;s Size (he is not trying
for anything subtle, simply the application of mass and power). If
he succeeds, he pushes the opponent into traffic. The opponent can
then consult the "being hit by a car"-chart to determine his fate
(and probably make a roll on Dex+Athletics to dodge cars, penalised
depending on traffic).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sensible_usage_of_maps"><a class="anchor" href="#_sensible_usage_of_maps"></a>Sensible usage of maps</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A map with figures/tokens/whatever representing characters and enemies
will be used for larger, central battles, if it is appropriate - for
example, for the assault on the Rahglu hive, for the attack on the Great
Slimy One, but not for the wild chase that was the final scene in the
battle for the Bleeding Stone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For smaller skirmishes, we won&#8217;t bother, so it is unlikely the map will
be used more than once or twice an adventure.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is now a Fighting Style: Wolf Form, which can be used in both
Urshul and Urhan. The Fighting Style offers a choice for each dot of the
merit bought - you can choose freely at each dot. You can also buy the
other alternative by spending 2xlevel XP.</p>

<p>\* Lurk: You have learned to circle your enemy, looking for an
opening while concentrating on defence. When you use Full Defence,
your opponent still takes the -1 Defence hit for being attacked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\* Grappling Bite: You can use your jaws to grapple an enemy,
forgoing precision for the chance to inflict pain. You can take a -3
penalty to your grapple attack. If you do so, the successes you
achieve cause both lethal damage and count as grapple successes.</p>

<p>*\* Hamstring: You have learned to hit where it hurts, inflicting
hindering injuries on your opponent. You can take a -3 penalty to
your attack roll. If the attack scores at least 1 success, it
additionally inflicts a -1 Penalty to Defence that stays until the
wound heals. This might not work on a number of spirits, like
Houses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*\* Exploit Advantage: You have learned to use an opening in the
opponent&#8217;s defence with terrifying swiftness and accuracy. If the
opponent is already at least at a -1 to Defence due to multiple
attackers or any other weakness (e.g. Hamstring), his Defence is at
an additional -1 for this attack.</p>

throat. You take a -2 hit to Defence to gain "9 again" on your
attack roll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*\*\* Overpower: Flinging yourself at the opponent, you use raw
power to overwhelm him and lock him in your jaws. If you grapple an
opponent, you can take a -3 penalty to your grapple roll. If you
still succeed, you can immediately follow up with an "Overpower"
manoeuvre (see WoD Rulebook, pp. 157-159).</p>

against the same opponent. Your defence is 0 until your next turn.
Successes on the two attack rolls are added for purposes of Kuruth
checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*\**\* Intuitive Reflexes: You let your instincts take over,
dodging enemy blows while closing in for the kill. You can use the
higher of your Dex or Wits for Defence. In addition, you only start
taking penalties for multiple attackers after the second attack, not
after the first as usual. You can still attack normally (but not use

<p>Pack Tactics (\* to *\*\*):</p>

<p>You instinctively know what help your friend needs, communicating by

<p>Grigori (Pack Tactics 1) helps Angus (Pack Tactics 2) dig up some
information. Angus gains a number of bonus dice on his Int+Academics
roll equal to 1/3 of Grigoris Int+Academics total, plus another 2 for
his Pack Tactics 2 (highest applicable). Even if Grigor (Pack Tactics 3)
is around in the library, his lacking knowledge (no Academics) means he
is unable to help and therefore his Pack Tactics do not count.</p>
