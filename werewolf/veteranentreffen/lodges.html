<h2 id="_bear_hunters"><a class="anchor" href="#_bear_hunters"></a>Bear Hunters</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since time immemorial, we hunt. And since then, we have used our
numbers as a tactic to overcome superior foes. The fact that we still do
so today is more than proof for the effectiveness of a pack against
unorganised foes. It is the essence of our existence. To be a Bear
Hunter means to live in the oldest tradition of warriors on earth.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Bear Hunters are a very ancient [lodge](lodge "wikilink") of Blood
Talons in the area of Scandinavia and northern Russia, with traditions
reaching back to the warrior tribes that inhabited the area during the
stone age and earlier. They emphasise working together to achieve a
goal, true to the saying 'the sum is greater than its parts'. While the
Bear Hunters are usually fierce warriors, they acknowledge that combat
is only the last step of a successful hunt. A good group of warriors
employing pack tactics will often have won before actual fighting takes
place, simply by stacking the odds high enough in their favour. The Bear
Hunters are very proud of their old roots, and claim that many of their
traditions and ceremonies have not changed in ten thousand years. Bear
Hunters are usually highly valued pack members, as they raise the
efficiency of the entire pack while on the hunt. Packs consisting
entirely of Bear Hunters are a part of local werewolf legends, and
usually credited with feats that would be considered impossible for
their numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bear Hunters are known to provide various advantages to their pack
members, employing tactics learned at the regular gatherings of the
lodge. Only few of these tactics involve direct combat - many deal with
preparing the battle ground and steering the prey into a position where
it can neither escape nor properly defend itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Bear Hunters are a very proud tribe, and they would never allow
outsiders to jugde themselves if they are ready to join the lodge.
Therefore, it is impossible to ask for membership - one has to receive
an invitation from within the lodge. That being sad, there are
[ways](Lodge_Initiations#Grigor&#8217;s_Lodge_Initiation "wikilink") to
expedite such an invitation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lodge regularly meets for set traditional occasions, often to
[hunt](The_hunt_at_Autumn_Equinox "wikilink") together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mechanical Benefits: Initiates of the Bear Hunters gain the Mentor merit
at one dot, as they are given an older member to help in their
integration process (and judge their progress).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Members of the Bear Hunters can learn the Pack Tactics merit as well as
one Fighting Style (their choice) at reduced cost, due to the constant
training in team combat. They also pay one dot less for the Socialize
skill, as they are more used to company than many other werewolves.
Lastly, they have access to some talens that the lodge produces at its
regular gatherings. Members can expect to be provided with roughly one
talen per year from these meetings.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_alliance"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_alliance"></a>The Alliance</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The werewolves in central St. Petersburg have formed a loose alliance.
As usual among werewolves, the term 'alliance' has to be treated with
care: All that is asked is that the packs let the 'high jugde' of the
alliance settle territorial conflicts among them before they get out of
hand. Some werewolves, especially those of the
[Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink") Lodge of the Storm Lords, feel
that even more cooperation would be preferable. However, they admit that
even this small alliance is something to be treasured, given the nature
of werewolves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason most packs join the alliance is that St. Petersburg was in
the hands of the Pure until a few years ago, when a joint effort - led
by [Victor Flammendes-Schwert](Victor_Flammendes-Schwert "wikilink") -
of the Forsaken drove them out of the city. Now, they are in the
outskirts and in the wilderness to the east, constantly trying to take
the city back from the Forsaken. Rumour has it that the [Peter and Paul
fortress](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_fortress" class="bare">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_fortress</a>) contains
a powerful locus home to a spirit of immense value to werewolves, but
the pack holding the territory ([Schatten der
Zaren](Schatten_der_Zaren "wikilink")) does not reveal what exactly it
is. Other rumour says that all members of the Enlightened Lodge are
privy to those secrets, but sworn to not even share them with their
pack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever resides there, the Pure want it badly, and as they outnumber
the Forsaken, the packs of the alliance cannot let infighting weaken
them too much or else the Pure will strike a killing blow.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blood_seekers"><a class="anchor" href="#_blood_seekers"></a>Blood Seekers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do you know why our tribe carries it&#8217;s name? It was Fenris-Ur who said
he would accept only those who could bathe their talons in the blood of
a true god. This is what we stand for. To truly reach your full
potential in combat, you must strive for this one goal Fenris-Ur gave
us.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The [lodge](lodge "wikilink") of Blood Seekers is a loose association of
Blood Talons around the world, who share one common philosophy: To be a
warrior means to constantly seek greater challenges, stronger foes to
best. Some packs value a Blood Seeker member for his contribution to the
overall fighting strength of the pack, while others - especially those
preferring a less direct approach - seem hesitant to accept someone in
their ranks whose highest goal in life is combat. The Blood Seekers are
often seen as the cliché of a Blood Talon, warriors who care for little
else but the thrill of melee - yet noone who ever witnessed a Blood
Seeker in battle can deny that some of them might truly have reached
their goal: The Blood Seekers are hands down the best fighters among the
Uratha in single combat. It is, after all, what they live for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blood Seekers constantly seek stronger enemies against which they can
measure themselves, and it is said that they possess strange Gifts that
allow them to find their foes, and to push their fighting prowess to a
point where they actually can take on stronger foes with a hope of
success.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_enlightened"><a class="anchor" href="#_enlightened"></a>Enlightened</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You ever wondered how humans managed to conquer the earth, despite all
their physical shortcomings? They work together. No matter if they see a
common purpose or follow someone out of fear or love, that is their
strength. And it&#8217;s about damn time we learn that, too.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Enlightened are a [lodge](lodge "wikilink") of Storm Lords in St.
Petersburg. Most see them as relatively new&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a product of the
[alliance](alliance "wikilink") forged by [Victor
Flammendes-Schwert](Victor_Flammendes-Schwert "wikilink")&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but there
are rumours that it is based on a much older organisation. The lodge is
mostly noted for keeping the alliance intact, and most packs of the
alliance have an Enlightened member, who more often than not is the
alpha.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The members of the lodge see themselves as diplomats, collectors of
knowledge and political leaders. Initiates have to prove themselves in
these field to gain full access to the inner secrets of the lodge. What
exactly these are is unknown, but it seems that a powerful spirit has
allied itself with the lodge and grants several benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Lodge will never ask anyone to join, as this would be considered a
sign of weakness. Instead, interested Storm Lords can announce their
intention to join the Lodge, upon which they will be subjected to a
[trial](Lodge_Initiations#Angus'_Lodge_Initiation "wikilink").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon being accepted into the lodge, [Angus](Angus "wikilink") is now an
Initiate of the Enlightened, which provides him with the free Merit
Allies(Enlightened) 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As laid out by [Victor
Flammendes-Schwert](Victor_Flammendes-Schwert "wikilink"), to advance in
the lodge the young Storm Lord has to carry out the duties the Lodge
imposes upon their members:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Librarian&#8217;s Duty</strong>: contribute an important piece of knowledge or
wisdom to the lodge&#8217;s ken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pack&#8217;s totem attests that by relating the story about the
struggle for the
[fate](The_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink") of the spirit
[Bleeding Stone](The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink"), Angus has
fulfilled this duty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leader&#8217;s Duty</strong>: show your willingness to lead by successfully
leading others through a dangerous situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By leading his pack through the troubles while [hunted by
mortals](The_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink"), Angus has
fulfilled this duty in the pack totem&#8217;s eyes. While he had the
perfect place to hide and direct their efforts, he instead chose
to come out and lead directly, thereby exposing him to great
danger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diplomat&#8217;s Duty</strong>: show your prowess in dealing with mortals,
spirits or other supernaturals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pack&#8217;s totem attests that Angus has fulfilled this duty
during his [creation of a Dog&#8217;s
Collar](Angus_crafting_a_Dog&#8217;s_Collar "wikilink").</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a member has completed those duties&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;witnessed and attested by
his pack totem&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;he will gain access to the
[secrets](The_Legend_of_the_Lodge_of_Enlightened "wikilink") of the
lodge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Membership in the lodge has the following mechanical benefits:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to their totem and the dedication of the lodge to their task,
members pay only two instead of three XP per dot for the Occult,
Politics and Persuasion skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extensive collection of local tales and legends grants a +2
bonus on extended research rolls. The lodge&#8217;s totem is free to
charge a favour for access, though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Known members of the lodge include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Victor Flammendes-Schwert](Victor_Flammendes-Schwert "wikilink"),
High Judge of the lodge and the [alliance](alliance "wikilink") it

<p>The [lodge](lodge "wikilink") of Lightning is a community of Iron
Masters all around the world, who dedicate themselves to understanding
the impact modern technology has made on the lives of the werewolves and
the duty of the Forsaken. For a long time, technological progress was
slow to non-existent, but in the last two centuries almost everything
has changed. This does not only affect the lives of humans - it also has
vast consequences for the spirit world, especially in the cities of the
modern world. Understanding these consequences is of the utmost
importance if one wants to keep the inhabitants of a city&#8217;s Hisil on
their side of the gauntlet.</p>

<p>The [lodge](lodge "wikilink") of Shepherds is one of the Iron Master
Lodges that are present in the area of St. Petersburg. Its members are
spread all over Europe and Russia. The emphasis of the lodge of
Shepherds is understanding the humans in your territory&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;what drives
them, what do they fear, what do they long for? As humans are the most
prominent source of essence, a deep understanding of the human part of
your territory can make managing the Hisil a lot easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is known that the Shepherds possess some rituals and fetishes that
help them stay in touch with their herd. No precise details are known
outside the lodge, though. The Shepherds also seem to value social
skills highly and have little problem learning them from each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Shepherds [take
in](Lodge_Initiations#Edouard&#8217;s_Lodge_Initiation "wikilink") any Iron
Masters that turn up. Initiates gain a mentor, often
[Andrej](Andrei_Wind-in-den-Straßen "wikilink") himself, represented by
the merit Mentor 1. They are then told to show they can understand
humanity, and that they need not make too much of an effort - the lodge
will know when they are ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After working his way into the social elite and gaining access to the
sponsors of Neighbours for Neighbours, Edouard was
[accepted](Charity_Dinner "wikilink") into the lodge by his mentor
[Vanka Iosiforna](Vanka_Iosiforna "wikilink").</p>

<p>Almost all werewolves in [Petersburg](Petersburg "wikilink") are part of
some [lodge](lodge "wikilink"). Usually, they chose their lodge and pass
their initiation within the first year after their respective [Tribe
Initiations](Tribe_Initiations "wikilink"). The members of the
Shadowclaws are no exception from that, and most of them have already
chosen which lodge they will try to enter.</p>

<h3 id="_angus_lodge_initiation"><a class="anchor" href="#_angus_lodge_initiation"></a>Angus' Lodge Initiation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[Angus](Angus "wikilink") is an Initiate of the
[Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink"). He passed his trial during the
[Battle against Rote Wut](Battle_against_Rote_Wut "wikilink"):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''The warehouse did not look different from all the others at the pier,
except for the brutish guy standing next to the entry. He passed Angus a
fierce glance, then nodded and opened the door.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''Stepping inside, the young Storm Lord noticed that the warehouse was
almost completely empty, except for a group of werewolves forming a
circle around some small bowls on the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'' 'Step closer, Angus Swims-under-Ice. We have been expecting you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''The werewolf at the far end of the circle had talked. He was an
impressive figure, measuring about two feet in his Dalu form and
wielding a huge two-handed sword, adorned with countless chains and
animal tokens. His bare body was covered in tattoos and markings,
showing the [Renown](Renown "wikilink") he had earned over the years. It
was none less then [Victor
Flammendes-Schwert](Victor_Flammendes-Schwert "wikilink"), eldest of the
Enlightened and High Jugde of St. Petersburg.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''There were about half a dozen werewolves present, all wearing nothing
but their tattoos, a few ornamental chains made mostly of animal parts,
and a weapon - some ritual, some looking quite deadly. Angus only
recognized two of them: [Vanya Sokolow](Vanya_Sokolow "wikilink") and
[Dima Kochegarov](Dima_Kochegarov "wikilink") of the pack [Litanei der
Straßen](Litanei_der_Straßen "wikilink").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''Not hesitating for even a moment, Angus stepped into their midst. He
knew that showing any form of weakness would be the quickest route to
failing any trial set by Storm Lords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'' 'What brings you here?', the High Jugde asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'' 'I wish to be accepted into the Lodge of Enlightened.', Angus
answered, in a determined voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'' 'Very well. Then you will answer our questions.'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''In a flash of light, the five bowls around Angus caught fire.
Immediately, the thick smell of heavy incense filled the air and clouded
the vision of the young Iminir. The smoke seemed to drift towards him,
wrapping him in a poisonous embrace and robbing him of his sense of
direction. Then the questions started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'' 'Define Discipline.' - 'What does your totem mean to you?' - 'What
would you die for?' - 'What does 'pack' mean to you?' - 'What is the
proper punishment for a pack member who violates the oath?'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''Angus fought against unconsciousness as the smoke filled his loungs
and poisoned his blood, yet he stood tall and proud and answered every
question without hesitating. There was no feedback to his answer except
for a new question, coming out of the smoke, untraceable, emotionless.
Reddish-black dots and lines started filling his sight, and he suspected
that the incense used here was on the list of illegal substances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''He couldn&#8217;t tell how long the questions continued or if there was any
feedback to his answers at a later date. At some point, he lost
consciousness and collapsed to the floor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''When he came to, he was still in the warehouse - lying naked on the
floor of the empty building. The only remains of the trial were the
smell of incense in his hair and a headache of monumental proportions.
There was no sign as to if he had passed or failed. He climbed to his
feet and staggered to the door - it was locked. Hesitating only breifly,
he broke down the door and somehow made his way home.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''For two days, he heard nothing from the Enlightened. Then he decided
that merely waiting for jugdement was not the way of the Storm Lords and
went to seek it himself. He travelled to the territory of the High
Judges pack and howled for a meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''Victor smiled as he greeted the young Iminir at the [Schatten der
Zarens](Schatten_der_Zaren "wikilink") border.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'' 'Congratulations, young Storm Lord. You have passed the trial. You
see, nothing we could set for your trial would ever match what Winter
Wolf subjected you to during your Initiation into our tribe. Yet the
fact that you return and ask for more shows us that you are willing to
dedicate yourself to the additional burden that lodge membership is. You
are now an Initiate of the Enlightened. Call upon us if your need is
dire.'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'' 'You know what our lodge stands for. We are scholars collecting the
knowledge needed to guard the Gauntlet. We are leaders needed to face
the dangers of two worlds. We are diplomats, for only a fool goes
without allies, and only a broken soul simply kills every problem he
encounters. Prove you can carry out our duties, and you will be
considered a true member.'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>''As the old werewolf turned and left the scene, Angus allowed himself a
smile. Another trial mastered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Angus was accepted into the lodge after proving himself, learning about
its [origins](The_Legend_of_the_Lodge_of_Enlightened "wikilink").</p>

<h3 id="_grigors_lodge_initiation"><a class="anchor" href="#_grigors_lodge_initiation"></a>Grigor&#8217;s Lodge Initiation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") aspires to join the [Bear
Hunters](Bear_Hunters "wikilink"). He already enquired about
requirements with [Yelena Dimitrovna](Yelena_Dimitrovna "wikilink"), but
received only the short (and blunt) answer that a werewolf with his
state of the soul would never be a member of the lodge. A werewolf below
Harmony 5 will simply not be able to truly understand the concept of
'teamwork' shared among the lodge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some weeks later, after [recent events](Grigor&#8217;s_contrition "wikilink"),
Grigor returns to speak with Yelena. He will tell her something of his
recent struggles to control his rage and his efforts to maintain his
humanity. (Harmony is now 5.) Since he is soon to be responsible for
leading a group of inexperienced fighters in battle (a Mafia "unit" of
youths in the south of the territory), Grigor desires to teach them to
fight effectively as a group. Also, he wants to learn how to prepare his
pack better for battle. As a gesture of his commitment, he swears never
to make any deals or alliances with the [Red
Court](Roter_Hof "wikilink") in his territory, since they represent
uncontrolled violence and rage. (He will only hint at his experiences
there.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yelena is shortspoken as ever, cutting in when Grigor starts speaking
about what he wants to learn. She tells Grigor that she will keep her
ears open about what the spirits will have to tell of his deeds. Since
the Red Court seems to be a problem in his area, once he has helped his
pack to a victory against them, she will hear him out. A victory without
innocent deaths and aside the whole pack, that is - not a solitary rage
where some spirits of the court happen to be among the victims. Until
then, she will not waste her time on him. If he cannot follow others
into battle and stick by their orders, there is no way he will ever
learn to lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the [fierce struggle](The_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink")
against the [red court](Roter_Hof "wikilink"), Grigor was approached by
Yelena. With considerable disdain, she told him that while she still
thought it a bit early, he was invited to a [collective
hunt](The_hunt_at_Autumn_Equinox "wikilink") of the Bear Hunters. There
he should be able to demonstrate his abilities and his willingness to
join.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was only after the events sorrounding the
[Eristoffs](Eristoffs "wikilink") that Yelena approached Grigor once
again. It was obvious that she knew about his recent rage, and what the
spirits where wispering. In few and strong words, she reminded him of
his duty to uphold his harmony. Then she reached into her pocket and
drew out a leather wristband. A piece of bone was worked into the
leather.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Extend your arm."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Grigor did as told. Yelena grabbed it and drew a knife, making a clean
cut across his underarm. Dipping her finger into the blood, she drew
some symbols onto the piece of bone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then she let go of his arm and repeated the procedure on herself.
Afterwards, she gave the band to Grigor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"This is a talen of our lodge. It is a symbol that we will bleed for
each other, and a reminder that we stand and fall together. Next time
you feel Kuruth grasping you, remember that. It will help you fight it."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"As for your full initiation, I will watch you closely. Your pack has
tasks ahead of it that will require a concerted effort. Remember your
lessons."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, she left without saying another word.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After hunting the Rahglu Queen with Boneblade, Yelena tells Grigor that
while he still has a long way to go, at least he has shown that he is
willing to step down from Glory for the sake of the team, thereby
proving himself worthy of being a Bear Hunter. He is now a full member
of the lodge (but still fresh, so his Mentor merit stays for a while).</p>

<h3 id="_edouards_lodge_initiation"><a class="anchor" href="#_edouards_lodge_initiation"></a>Edouard&#8217;s Lodge Initiation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the mayor finished his speech and walked to his car,
[Edouard](Edouard "wikilink") couldn&#8217;t help but smile. That man hat not
moved a finger to have the new [youth club](youth_club "wikilink")
build, but naturally claimed all the credit. Not that he&#8217;d mind - it was
better if no one knew of his involvement, although it had cost him quite
some money. As far as the City administration was concerned, the money
had come from some private investors who would like to remain unnamed,
fearing they might be bothered by requests for aid from a multitude of
charity organisations if their involvement came to light.
[Angus](Angus "wikilink") had handled that - the alpha knew where he had
to go in the administration to get things done, and whom to avoid to
keep things secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A bit to his right, [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") gave Edouard an
approving nod as he stepped into the shining new building. A youth
center for the children of the impoverished immigrants in the south of
Admiralteyski - the idea had come from the Rahu, but the pack as a whole
approved of it. Edouard turned and left. The celebration here was not
for him. No doubt there would be a 'charity dinner' or something in the
better part of the city, where the rich would pad themselves on the
shoulder, applauding their charity while sipping incredibly expensive
wine out of crystal glasses. That was where he belonged, listening to
their gossip, trying to spot what motivated the 'makers' in the city. At
least, that&#8217;s what he made of the credo of the
[Shepherds](Shepherds "wikilink"), whom he had recently requested to
join.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He remembered [Andrej&#8217;s](Andrei_Wind-in-den-Straßen "wikilink") words.
'Alright, so you wanna join? And now you&#8217;re wondering, what trial will
we set? Well, you&#8217;re already an Iron Master. You know we are not one of
those crazy 'rip-your-guts-out-to-prove-your-dedication' organisations
as the Blood Talons or Storm Lords tend to go. If you really wanna join,
well, you&#8217;re in. Turn to me if you ever have questions. If you can&#8217;t
answer them by yourself, that is.'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'You know what the Shepherds are about. We tend to the herd like noone
else. Only by truly understanding them will you be able to understand
the huge impact they have on your territory, on both sides of the
Gauntlet. So, what we&#8217;d like to see from you is that you can do just
that. Understand humanity. Sounds simple, da? Well, as I said, don&#8217;t rip
your guts out. We know when you are ready. See ya\!'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then he had left Edouard standing alone, somewhat confused. The young
Cahalith thought for a moment and then decided that, typically for the
Iron Masters, he&#8217;d have to figure out himself exactly what they wanted
him to do. So he had set about making his way into the social elite.
After all, he knew from his life as a human that money was the name of
the game - and he intended to play.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Edouard was [accepted](Charity_Dinner "wikilink") into the lodge after
[strategic investments](Strategic_Investment "wikilink")
[into](Investors_for_Neighbours "wikilink") [Neighbours for
Neighbours](Neighbours_for_Neighbours "wikilink").</p>
